       "  \"I bought this product on 30th Aug 2018 after reading so many reviews and researching other tv's at this price range.Below are my reviews after one week of usage,1. Picture quality is good even for SD channels(Comparatively better than MI in this price range).2. Sound quality is not that great but ok.3. Web touch remote is really great option.4. By default it has apps like hotstar, youtube, facebook and netflix. Connecting to wifi is easy and there is no issue till now.Cons:1. Poor Installation service. Installation person came after a week and he is not good at his service and he even didn't know much about the product and how to install it in the wall. He literally damaged the wall with multiple retries.2. Casting(M-Cast and normal cast) is won't work with all the mobile devices. I have Moto G6 which can't be connected to this TV but Lenova mobiles are connecting easily.  But it has Eshare which will connect your phone and TV and you have to install app in the phone.3. Not all wireless USB and Keyboards are supported. You need to search for the specific wireless devices. I have Logitech Wireless(With Nano Receiver) mouse which is not connecting at all.Note: They won't provide batteries for the remote.Overall, it's  good product at this price range. I will update here If I face any issues.Thanks.\",\n",

I look for everything was available online sites finally came across this television had great ratings on Amazon read all the reviews which prompted me to buy it but I was still sceptical until I got the delivery. When installation was completed I was amazed at the kind of picture quality and the quality of black colour the depth of image in the overall experience. This is an amazing television for the price that you're getting at this price point!!!! just amazing picture quality, amazing sound and amazing overall Android performance. Even Prime Video works awesome on it, so its just better than Mi TV. I think everyone looking for a TV should definitely go for it\",\n",

Highly disappointed.I called the customer care team but the number was always busy, waited for 15-20 min on line by but was not connected to the human customer executive and hence I finally disconnected the phone.I am highly disappointed with the Installation and demo service as it is still incomplete.And I need compensation for the burning/damage of my set up box.As Kevin team is responsible for my this loss.Also, Kindly assign an expert technician to complete my installation and demo service.',\n",
