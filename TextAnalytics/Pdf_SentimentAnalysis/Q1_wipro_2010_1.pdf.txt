Let us focus for the moment on the IT business — Another good quarter where we beat the top
end of our guidance in constant currency terms with a sequential growth of 4.4%. We have had

the highest increase in our net billable headcount ever in this quarter.

BFSI, CMSP, Manufacturing and RCTG led growth for us among the verticals. Product
Engineering Services, Package Implementation and ADM led growth among the horizontals.
India & Middle East, and APAC continue s to see strong growth, with US also seeing a n uptick

this quarter. Europe grew at 3.4% at constant currency basis and 20.8% year-on-year.

We have seen yet another quarter of margin expansion. Margins have increased by 30 basis

points to 24.5% despite headwinds of wage increase and decline in our price realization. Margins
have expanded by 2 .4% year-on-year. We took over the data center in Germany from Citi, which
will enable us to offer a full portfolio infrastructure management solution to our European

clients.

We continue to uncompromisingly invest in our business for the future, example, technology
themes with particular focus on Green and Cloud of Horizon-2 and Horizon -3 themes driving
productized solutions across horizontal s and verticals. Non-linearity which today is 10% of our
revenue and we are targeting 14% of our revenues in the current financial year , strong consulting

and systems integration, transformational capability, and investments in sales and consultancy.

We remain committed to driving globalization and localization in our t eams. We continue to
scale up our delivery center across the globe. We have crossed the 500 persons mark in China
this quarter. We continue to localize our teams overseas. Our aim is to increase the percentage

of locals in our workforce overseas to 50% in the next two years. As of Quarter 1, it was ~38%.

Let me go on to our consumer business — Santoor, #3 brand in India remains the main driver of
our India household business which we continue to diversify in this segment with strong gr owth
across Glucovita, a healthcare drink, diapers, and CFLs. In our international business, we
continue to grow driven by markets like China, Malaysia , and the Middle East. Commercial
business has seen significant pickup though not back to peak levels yet. Yardley is fully

integrated and is tracking ahead of plan in terms of our acquisition.

Wipro Infrastructure Engineering — The business environment has seen a significant rebound. In
Europe things are much better but far from being great. We are back to 55% to 60% of peak

level. In India we are back to about 90% of peak levels.

Eco energy — We continue to believe that this can be a hit business in the future and the not to
distant future. A huge area of growth is in the energy managed space services. We have already
won two deals in this. Our confidence in our business model has increased significantly validated

by the market and by our wins.

good momentum of revenue growth with a revenue growth of 23% year-on-year and an
operating profit growth of 11% on year-on-year basis. On the Foreign exchange front, our
realized rate for the quarter was 45. 69 versus a rate of 45.11 realized for the quarter ended March
2010. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, FOREX gave us a positive impact to margins including t he
impact of cross-currency of 60 basis points. As at period end, we had about $1.6 billion of Forex
contracts. Our net cash balance on the balance sheet was Rs. 49 billion generated a free cash flow

of Rs. 6 billion during the quarter. We'll now be glad to take questions .

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with the question and answer sess ion. Our

first question is from line of Harit Shah from Karvy Stock Broking. Please go ahead.

Yeah thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a good set of numbers sir. I just wanted
to get a sense that in this quarter we saw a good g rowth in package implementation. So c ould
you give some sense of whether or not discretionary spending is on an increase definitely one of
your peers has referred to alluded to this fact, so are you seeing the same kind of trends in this

particular space?

Yes the package implementation has seen extremely good growth this quarter , around 9.7%.
Clearly we are seeing discretionary spending picking up in this space . There is a pent-up demand
for upgrades in this sector, so are seeing a lot of upgrade type of business in this sector. The
significant investments are also happening in social computing solutions, CRM solutions, and
sustainability solutions as well as Cloud applications like CRM. So net-net, discretionary
spending is happening in this sector and we see a very strong outlook for this business line in

context of our business.

Sure, sir, I just need a color on the kind of the business that you are seeing and increase in

demand for these particular services going for ward?
Are you speaking about specifically package implementation?
Yeah that’s correct.

See manufacturing is for one a very big segment for package implementation. We are seeing
strong demand also in the retail sector, in the CPG sector, in the energy and utility sector, also in
the health care sector. And frankly we are also beginning to see demand pick up as it relates to
specifically CRM type of applications in the banking sector as well . So it is broad based, but yes
to the preponderance surrounds the retail CPG, energy and utilities and the manufacturing

sectors.

Thank you, that’s very helpful. And just an other query, you have mentioned that I think non linear growth revenues are at around let us say 10% of the revenues, can you give us some sense

of the business initiatives that you are taking?

So I will ask my colleague, Mr. Sambuddha Deb who is our Chief Deliver Officer to address
this.

Hi there. There are primarily four broad initiative s that we take, one is from delivery side which
we look at what we called Shared Services Model that is delivery model which ensures that
while you can add more work into the system you do not have to add more headcount. The
second is the earlier one where we talk about intellectual property where you have your own
components which you put it in a license and hence increase the reuse dramatically. The third
one which we have are platform-oriented services where you have a standard platform and you
build up that, so this is very convenient when you have IT plus BPO type of stuff. And the fourth

thing we are looking at is variabilization of a part of our workforce which ensures that our

workforce doesn’t increase beyond the point.

Okay fair enough sir. Can you give like any specific examples, in terms of platforms, what are

you doing on that front, if you could do that?

The major platform that we have is a platform called base in BPO, which allows youtorun inthe

same security settlement on one unified platform.

Okay, sir thank you, that was very helpful. I will come back if I have any further questions.
Thank you sir.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vihang Naik from MF Global. Please go ahead.

Hi, congrats on decent quarter. I was just curious about, you have done pretty good margin
management, I was just curious if you could just throw some light on how much the headwinds

and the tailwinds contribute d to the margins in this quarter?

Very clearly we had benefits of good exchange rate management that we had held by decent spot
rate and also our hedges were at a higher rate when the spots were down, so we were able to get
benefits which offset the OCI impact that came in the quarter. And if you | ook at the net impact
of dollar-INR and cross currency, we got 0.6% upside on margin s in QI over Q4. We also got
benefits in terms of managing our bulge which is when we are hiring freshers, the average cost of
people keep coming down. And like for example all the mat rices that you see are typically
reflective of our performance on the IT business. But we have the India , Middle-East business
and we have acquisitions like Infocrossing and the BPO business which are not necessarily

reflected in these matrices. And as we had projected earlier, been able to get benefits of various

initiatives we have taken to improve those profitabilit ies. So a combination of all of this helped
us overcome the impact of the full quarter impact of salary increase and also the negative impact
of cross currency. Having said that, in Quarter 2 we do see the currency to be a headwind for us
and we have taken various initiatives on the employee side, outside of the MSI or the salary
increase we have given in February and that is in the nature of the stock units that we have given,
the broad-banded progression that we did at junior levels which is covering almost 20,000
employees. And a total of all of this adds up to more than a percentage of revenue, so the
primary headwind getting into Quarter 2 is the impact that the currency will have which is the
OCI impact that will hit the margins and the impact of the various increases and the expense that

we have done on the people side.

Right that was helpful. You know if you could just tell me what was the impact on margins fro m

the pricing decline that you have seen in this quarter?

So, on the constant currency basis we had the decline primarily on the onsite rate and slight ly on

the offshore rate. And the margin impact because of all the rate movements is in the range of 1%.

Right. I mean although we report the attrition on annualized basis at turn around 23%, I mean the
shoot up in the attrition budget really ma kes us think about second salary hike during the year or

how are we placed about it?

Well at this point in time, we have had a salary increase in February and we are taking various
initiatives on the people side as I have already articulated. And our last salary increase had an
impact of 1.5% on margin and the initiative we are now taking is more than a percentage. So
while we have not done a broad-based salary increase the intervention is quite significant,
however, having said that we believe that we are not in a panic mode . We believe salary is not
the only solution for people retention and that is reflective of some of the things that has
happened in our peer group as well and we are taking a lot more action on the HR side whic h
may not be reflected in financials to ensure that we create an environment where people want to

stay with us.

Okay. And I thought I heard you say that pricing decline particularly onsite was also due to fact
that new projects were started ons ite, could you just share the nature of these projects and if most
of the pricing decline that we had to see has come in this quarter and also some color on the

pricing scenario you are seeing in the sector as such?

So let me first talk about the pricing features. On a broad -based basis, I think there is more
positivity than anything on the pricing front where we have had negotiations with clients , they
have been reasonable and flexible and we have seen in many situations where actually we have
been able to increase the pricing . If you ask me the broad business environment, there is more

positivity on price increase upward s than anything else. So on a coupon prices basis, I would say

prices would tend to increase. The way we compute price realization is look at revenue divide by
total billable headcount and there what happ ens, there is quarter-to-quarter movement which
depends on how many new projects we have started and typically in a multi -quarter projects, the
initial phase is around the k nowledge acquisition or transition which doesn’t get explicitly paid

for. So as per accounting standards, we will not recognize revenue during that period, but efforts
will be there to expend and as a result of which it may look that we have dipped realiza tion, but

in reality, it does not reflect the underlying pricing environment.

Right. And whatever those initial stages are about in knowledge acquisition and all , those are

mostly done in this quarter as such .

If you look at our volume growth last quarter , where we had the significant volume growth or a
lot of that volume growth was about starting new projects that’s how volume growth takes place .
When you have significant volume growth there is still a necessary condition tha t new projects
will start then when you go and when new projects start, there is an initial phase where
investments has to be made, so that’s what we are seeing. So if we continue to see strong volume

growth quarter -after-quarter and it leads to many more projects starts, this thing could continue.
Excellent, okay that was helpful thanks .
The next question is from the line of Mitali Ghosh from Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Good afternoon. First question, I just wanted to get a bit more color on the deals closed this
quarter in terms of large deals and perhaps more than $50 million deals. And last time you had

shared total contract value during the quarter, so just looking fo r those details.

I can't be too specific on this, but just to give you a broad sense, I think it's been a good quarter
from an order booking perspective as well . It has been a good quarter from the deal wins that we

have had and some of that we brought up in the press release. We see the funnel that we are

looking at today in Quarter 1, looking fairly strong. So getting into Quarter 2, the funnel looks
fairly strong. The funnel is broad-based. It is not localized to any specific vertical, but if I have to

single out some of the verticals where one sees a fairly strong demand outlook, it includes Retail
and CPG where we see a strong outlook going forward. It includes Banking, Finance, and the
BFSI segment of ours. It also includes Manufacturing, Energy & Utilities and Healthcare where
we are investing heavily and where we are seeing a _ significant demand pickup as it relates to the
following. Specifically on your question of the deal wins that we had this quarter, we have had 7

large deals that we won this quarter. When I say large, the deal that is greater than $30 million.

Okay that’s helpful. And just in terms of the project start this quarter that you had onsite, any
color in terms of which services and verticals or is that broadly reflected I guess in the metrics

that you shared.

I think it's broadly reflected in the metrics that you have seen, I mean as you have seen, our

business has moved towards much more fixed price projects and this is not a gain very sectoral. It
is broad-based and we have been winning quite a few fixed price projects so a lot of which have
got initiated last quarter and which is why the specific investments that we ha d to make in those

fixed price projects.

Sir secondly on the margins, you mentioned some headwind next quarter, but last quarter if we
recall, you were sort of comfortable with managing margins within a narrow band for the full

year. I just wanted to check whether there was any change in that thinking?

What we are saying Mitali is that we don’t give spe cific guidance, but in a medium -to-long term,
these are margins which are sustainable, so quarter-to-quarter is not something we would like to

guide there.
Sure, sir for the full year, you would be comfortable?

No, we are saying in a medium -to-long term, these are margins which are sustainable margins,
what we are not even talking about the year because when you talk about a year it is always

rolling for four quarters right.
Okay thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Anurag Purohit from Alchemy. Please go

ahead.

Good afternoon gentlemen and congratulations on good quarter. My question was regarding
utilization, how difficult would be to maintain utilization at current levels when attrition is
running in excess of 23% on annualized basis we should be considering that a lot of recruitment

in coming quarters would be for freshers .

Last year we invested a lot in rec rafting our supply chain, invested a lot in IS to ensure that we
are able to do just-in-time hiring as well as just-in-time deployment. With that we see that the
current levels being sustainable give or take 0.5% or 1% because some of them depend s on how
we see the outlook coming. There is also a little bit of function of how we absorb freshers and

you know freshers are little bunched in the second half of the year.

Okay, but is my estimate correct that current number of amount of trainees wi Il be close to 3% in
the system? And another question regarding the subcontracting expenses which has moved up

material in this quarter, how should we look at the trend going forward?

I think it will drop somewhat, the subcontracting would drop somewhat, the subcontracting

onsite would drop, but in offshore we are actually variabilizing our workforce, so that will again

come up as subcontracting, so I would g uess it will more or less remain where it is, but it in

dollar terms it may reduce, but in headcount terms it won't.
Okay thank you and all the best.
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pinku Pappan from Nomura. Please go ahead.

Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. First question is on your TIS service line, I
was a bit surprised to see the kind of muted growth in this quarter considering that in the US
there has been quite a bit of an explosio n of demand in terms of data surveys and hosting

services, so what exactly the trends you are seeing there and what is outlook in the service line?

The outlook is very very positive and it relates to our TIS and Infocrossing business. So I d id
answer the question on what the funnel outlook was earlier, but if one was to look at the service
line view of the funnel that we current have built up, a large proportion of the funnel is

technology infrastructure services and the integrated propositio n that we offer with IFOX. What
you are currently seeing is a muted growth in the quarter because you are | ooking at the
sequential growth, year-on-year growth has been good, but more importantly I think the outlook
and the funnel and the buildup that we have had and the proposition that we are able to deliver in
the integrated proposition of the infrastructure and IFOX is enabling us to address and open up

large deals in this segment.

You also mentioned that you acquired a data center from Citibank, has that already been booked

in your revenues for TIS in this particular quarter?
No, it has not been booked from a revenue perspective.
I mean it's just a takeover of the data center

So it's not been booked from a revenue perspective, and it is a takeover of Citibank’s data center
which will include for a period of time services which will include continuation of services that
we provide to Citibank, so that is one. But you know the big story behind this really is we have
had Infocrossing in the US so we have been very, very success ful in integrated deals that we won
in the US. We have had data center presence in India, but so far we did not have data center
presence in Europe. So this gives us that capacity that we need to address integrated deals in the
European market so that is a big plus of this acquisition of the data center that we have done.
And I did mention earlier but I am not too sure that I communicated adequately we are working

on quite a few large deals in the TIS space, which are significant in terms of size.

Okay. Do you see data center services getting commoditized as we go ahead? I mean how is the

pricing trend there?

If you are talking about the data center hosting type of business, yes it is a commodity business,
but if you are really talking about the types of services that we offer, which is integrated
managed data center services for customers that is not getting comm oditized, it is more end -toend, it needs differentiation. It needs a lot of specific unique infrastructure capability. It needs
system integration capability, it needs virtualization capability and we have all of that as a part of

the TIS proposition. So hosting, yes integrated managed data center services clubbed.

I am sorry for pressing this but again just on the same topic, we see every offshore vendor
talking about virtualization, managed data service, I mean the kind of services that you are
talking about virtualization in Cloud, so do you see an environment there, is this also going to get

commoditized?

We are specifically speaking about Cloud, I think the whole theme of Cloud is evolving. We are
very, very actively invest ing in the Cloud theme. It is one of our, I would say, big investment
themes across our IT business. We have built up and _ we will continue to build up strong system
integration capabilities around Clouds. We have actually built up strong system integration
capability both around private Cloud and in terms of being able to integrate public Clouds and
private Clouds in terms of total solutions for our customers. I think it's far away from
commoditization the way you put it, just to give you a sense of some of the work that we are
doing for customers. There is a fairly large customer for whom we are actually architec ting the
Cloud strategy as it relates to their application, as it relates to their infrastructure where they are
today, where they could be tomorrow, how they could leverage private Clouds and public Clouds
to really create the next generation IT architect ure so to speak, so that’s the sort of work we are

engaged in now.

Okay. Thanks for clarifying that and just one more question, your offshore volume growth has
not been so great and when you look at peers, actually they have had couple of ve ry strong

quarters of offshore volume growth, so what exactly is the difference here ?

I think we have won quite a few system integration deals and this means in the initial stages
more richer are onsite presence because this is all about architecting, meeting the customer,
putting the architecture in space, so it does need a lot of onsite presence in the initial parts of the

project which is what you are seeing.
Sure thanks a lot.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Srivatsan Ramachandran from Spark Capital.

Please go ahead.

I just wanted to get a sense on, product engineering has seen a substantial growth during the

quarter, I just wanted to know which are the end markets in terms o f where you have seen the

growth, is it any one-off projects that has come that has led to this growth or do you see kind of

at least from an absolute number point of view kind of maintaining this kind of a number?

You know Product engineering has had a phenomenal quarter, but it has two parts to it, one
which is kind of sustainable long term basis, which is general pickup in the engineering services.
Again driven to a large extent by the traditional markets that is engineering services, which is
technology, semiconductor and so on and there is a strong cyclical upturn there in those markets
and that should continue to remain strong for the rest of t his year as well. We are also making
efforts to address other industry sectors whether it's healthcare, whether it is manufacturing,
whether it is aerospace. So we are working strongly to diversify our engineering services sales
set up. So this is a good news of secular visibility of growth in engineering services. However,
this quarter there is a one timer which has kind of bumped up the sequential growth which is as
high as 18% on a sequential basis, so it clearly is not something that’s going to get repeated
there. But broadly speaking engineering services is clearly on an upswing and it's som _ ething that

we could scale up.

Okay. I just wanted understand impact of promotions and wage hike will affect on this quarter

numbers or is it the only for a particular period?

The salary increase that was given in Februa ry and the progressions that was done pre -July that
is all already into the quarter one report. The July 1 * Restricted Stock Units and band split that
we have done which is covering almost 20,000 employees are new interventions which has not

got reflected in our quarter one financials.
Okay thanks a lot, I will come back later.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Nitin Padmanabhan from Indiabulls Securities.

Please go ahead.

Yeah hi, thanks for taking my question. This was regard s to the margins if I can probe a little
more. If you see over the past two quarters, I think as a percentage it has come down, it's
probably just moved up by 5% despite adding maybe 14% -15% to the headcount, you ment ioned
that you know quite a bit of the cost benefits came from the acquisitions Infocrossing and
probably India and Middle East , could you just explain what is the nature of those and how much

more of those takeouts are possible going forward?

So let me first make sure I understand your question correctly. The margins actually have

expanded in the last two quarters and I think that’s what you meant, right?

The cost of revenues basically as a percentage come down, th e gross mar gin improved in fact?

That’s right. So as I mentioned earlier, one we have had improvement in currency, but outside of
currency the benefit has really been in the businesses which are outside of what gets reflected in
the matrices and that inc ludes profitability of our BPO business that includes profitability of our
Infocrossing Data Center business and we have seen uptick there. And we continue to drive
higher capacity utilization, better utilization m etrices in the BPO business. And at this point in
time, we are already at a significantly high capacity utilization in the Infocrossing business and
we are acquiring data centers and we are creating new capacities. So, while there is an
opportunity to continue driving margins there, but it's difficult to give a specific number in terms

of what any of those businesses will give.

Aright. Manish, if you could just go a little further, Infocrossing I think we were close to peak
capacity, I think a quarter or two back and I think if you are adding more capacit ies ideally that
should bring down profitability a bit, right? Is there a downward bias by any chance? Is there a

headwind to this going forward?

So typically Nitin, what happens is the sale cycle and the migration cycle in the Infocrossing
business is quite long and as you rightly said in last to last quarter, we had already sold out our
capacity while the migration of assets from the customer to our data centers would probably not
have happened even now and as we create capacity, there will be cost addition to our
Infocrossing business. So you ’re right that there probably would be a headwind to margins for a

couple of quarters to come as we start ramping up and seeing better uti lization of capacity.
Okay same would be the case for BPO as well?

BPO unlike in Infocrossing does not have step cost s and does not have capacity addition and
hence margin impact quarter -on-quarter and it may not give us significant movement from where

we are today.

Sure, sir, just one last thing on the hedges, you mentioned that this time we had some sort of a
gain due to favorable hedges for the quarter, it may not be sustainable for the next quarter, if you

could just throw some light on that?

With respect to the forex, this particular quarter we had a hedge book which gave us a better rate
realization and what you see in the next quarter is that we have taken certain long term hedges
which matured in the next quarter and those hedges were at a lower rate. Hence overall rate
realization will drop a bit. So that is what Manish was meaning when he said that you will some

forex headwinds.
Sir, thank you.

Hi, I have one question, can we have the breakup of the capital employed by each businesses?
Ravi, it is there is in the segment report.

No, I have checked out, what I got was basically your revenues and PBIT, but I don’t think I
have the breakup of capital employed.

So capital employed if you look at IT services and product, it's Rs. 129059 million, Consumer

care and lighting Rs. 20877 million, others Rs. 119044 million.
Okay thanks.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Deepesh Mehta from Khandwala Securities.

Please go ahead.

Just stretching on our margin performance, I just wanted to know whether there is any kind of
one-off what we don’t ex pect to recur in Q2? Second question is about our BPO business, it
shows some kind of sluggishness, so your comment about performance going forward. And last
is about our employee hiring plan for full year considering higher attritio nas well as we see good

demand. Thanks.

So your question specifically on, are there any one time benefits that we got in Q1 which we
don’t expect to recur from our operating margin perspective. See you may consider this one time, you may consider this a recurring phenomenon because when you are doing fixed price
business and you have cyclicality in revenue, which is what got reflected last quarter and this
quarter if you have seen as we commented last quarter that our revenues are low because fixed
price projects have this nature of revenues which are linked to either transition or milestone and
this quarter we have had upside. So that kind of one -timer we have, however if we have to say
that there is something which is one -time and real one-time I don’t think there is anything like

that.

Specifically addressing your BPO question, yes this year the sequential growth has been
sluggish-to-negative. If you really look at it from a year-on-year basis, it's 15.5% growth. I think
more importantly this was related to some project closures that we had in Quarter 4 and some
one-timers that were accrued in Quarter 4. But going forward, the outlook of the business is
fairly positive, the decisions are happening faster. We have made good progress in lots of
pursuits a large part of the funnel that we spoke about earlier have BPO and as much as I spoke
about TIS earlier. And we are seeing interest in integrated IT and BPO opportunities emerging in

the market and some we are creating. The transaction processing part of our business today now
accounts for as much as 55% of the total BPO business. So we have go t scale there and we have

got good width and robustness as it relates to horizontal processes. What w e are going to do

going forward more aggressively on our BPO business is build up a lot more unique vertical
processes in the different industry segments. So all in all we do believe that BPO will be one of
the significant growth driver for us going forwar d and a differentiator in the market for us in
terms of the integrated BPO IT proposition s that we can get to the market. I didn’t get your third

question.

On the hiring front, we have ramped up the engines and actually we have taken into account both
the attrition as well as future demand and we think that we are there for that. We don’t see any

shortfall in talent because of our hiring and _ not hiring.
But can you share some numbers, how much we are planning to hire at gross or net level?

We don’t share the gross headcount which you normally hear. What we do share is the net
headcount add and if you look for the last three quart ers, we have had 15,000 people and this
quarter we added 4854.

Sir, can you share the | ateral employees out of 15000 odd what we had had in last three quarters?

A reasonable mix with lateral, so we don’t give specific numbers between the lateral and rookies

per se.

When we say reasonable, that is above trend or that is more or less what we have seen in last five

years average?

So what I meant here is that take for example, if you are over 50%, it would be lateral side.
Okay thanks.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rahul Jain from Dolat Capital. Please go ahead.
My question is can you explain movement in the tax rate in the quarter?

Tax rate for the quarter was about 15% which is after the write back for the March period based
on some assessment closure and so if you look at a normalized rate, it would be about 2 % points

higher. At average which would be similar to the average of last year.
Okay. So that is what we are expecting for the rest of the year?
Well it will be within the 2% range.

Okay and another thing is on the health care side, we have seen a reasonable drop in the particular

quarter, is it aberration or something we are looking into that?

It is because of certain project closures and one-time heavily accruals that we got in Q4. It is a
quarter aberration. If you also look at it from year-on-year perspective the growth is actually
25%, which is fairly solid growth. Like I mentioned earlier, we are investing in the healthcare
business, we are trading some strong industry solutions in the new generation areas of ICD 9 -10
electronic medical records and healthcare information exchanges and all these are new
opportunities that are coming up in the US. So it is an area of major investment for us. We do see

healthcare to be one of o ur high growth verticals going forward.

And sir just to understand what could be the possibility because you know we are seeing attrition
level going up for all the players, all across we are seeing a hike in the salary cost, so are we
likely to see increase in the terms of the attrition rates or increasing in the terms of bench so that

we address that issue?

As you said rightly the industry attrition has gone up and the same has been for us and we have
seen that it will take another couple of quarters for it to stabilize. We don’t see anything
changing overnight from attrition perspective. And we have seen four or five levers to manage

attrition, be it from a career standpoint or compensation standpoint or rotation. So we are + moving

on all the levers to manage attrition and i t's not one which we will look at.
Sir, that means we would be looking fora bigger bench for that sense?

No as Deb had said earlier, but I would like to add. We manage the supply chain, people supply
chain in a fashion where we have been able to manage a much linear bench and we are able to do

hiring as well as managing attrition .
Okay that’s it from my side, thanks a lot.
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah from ICICI. Please go ahead.

This is just which relates to the cost of revenue, for the last three quarters, we have added on a
net basis close to around 15,000 and one of your comments was also that close to around 50 % is
through laterals. And we also had a wage inflation with effect from February, but if you look at
the average cost of revenue per technical employee has been going down for last two quarter s
versus for the peers that’s been going up. So does that mean that over and above from July
onwards the RSU as well as the promotions there could be a wage inflation in the Q3 or in the

Q4 also?
See one is that when you talk about the laterals what Rajendra talked about it is linked to gross

and not to net, because when there is attrition of an experienced person, it tends to be replaced

with an experienced lateral. So therefore that was on the basis of gross and not the net.

And just to supplement Sandeep to what Senapaty just mentioned o ther than the fact that if you
were to look at net addition as rookies or as freshers as a percentage of net addition that number
will be different from what Rajendra mentioned. The other points to note is that when the growth

happens and volume adds are happening, if we are ona quarter-on-quarter basis adding freshers,
more than that we had ad ded before, the average cost will keep going down. And the impact of
salary increase is reflected in the people cost as a percentage going up to some extent it's also

reflected due to the utilization drop, however , a significant portion of increase in peop le cost as a
percentage of revenue is because of the salary increases that we have given. And typically this

model is self regulating because as the growth comes back and we keep adding freshers the
average cost will keep coming down and people cost as a percentage of revenue will get

managed.

Okay, sir this year also we will go back to our trend of giving wage hikes from August 
September or this year maybe a different than the historic trends?

The situation is fairly fluid and dynamic so we will have to respond to the situation for example,
this quarter alone we have done a re-banding and created a brand new category of people 3-7
years category and as a result of that we have promoted almost 20,000 people and there is a cost
associated with that. So we will look at all the avenues by which we need to respond on the
compensation side. So many of the traditional cycles may change, if you have done something
now, we may push something out or we may bring something forward, so it's difficult to go by

history in this kind of current situation.
Okay thanks.
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Diviya Nagarajan from UBS. Please go ahead.

Hi, congrats on a good quarter. Just one question that I had was on the recruitment front. We
have heard the company so far talk about ramping up on the lateral three to eight years so to
speak and I think some of the numbers that we have heard from you is quite aggressive . In that
context, how easy do you think it will be for you to recruit aggressive ly from the market given
the kind of volume growth that you are looking at? And what impact do you foresee on

incremental wage costs because of this?

We have been able to hire fairly I would say strongly from the market when it comes to lateral

hiring over the last two or three quarters from the time the market opened up. And given that the
engine is ramped up, I really see no big challenge, I mean of course the re will be reasons why we
will not be able to hire a particular category of people or not exactly meet our demands, but that
will be at a periphery and not at the core. So at the core, I think we will be able to hir e the

numbers that we wanted and the skil 1 sets that we want. And what you said is right that when you

hire laterally of course it kind of raises the bar on some stations and that’s what we have to kind

of manage that typically between internal wage hikes and hiring people from the market.
Right thanks.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Shraddha Agarwal from B&K Securities. Please
go ahead.

Hi sir, congrats on good quarter. Just one question, your top clients have grown quite strongly in
this quarter, they have grown by some 20% on a sequential basis, so is this growth in any way

related to the new project start that you were talking about?

The top line growth which is really all the efforts that we have made in the past in building
strong client relationship and investing in that accounts and we really expect that with other
investments that we have made around client relationship, onsite pr ogram management and
consulting, we will be able to continue to build stronger traction in some of our top clients. And
may I request Martha who is here who is with Global Sales Organization to talk about

investment and hopefully the returns.

So let me just address that in pretty deeper sense and the area of focus for us over the past couple
of years has been in really building a very strong best-in-class sales organization. The areas that
we are investing in is for example are tools, which include account management and how we
manage the opportunity and really g uiding into the core of what is our customer strategy and
how we partner with them to help and shape that strategy. We are looking at ways which realign
recognition and performance between the sales organization and what we do with delivery.
Again just locking in fact how we manage our customers, how we motivate our own internal
people to execute on our commitment. And then that goes hand in hand with training, training
that is done very specifically towards the account management structure and what we expect
from our sales organization in ensuring that we address our customers’ challenges. And I think it
is a combination of all these three things, the alignment in the field, the focus that we have by
market segments by verticals and by service lines that brings together a very good story for our
customer hopefully. We will make them successful and will continue to grow along with the

growth of our customers.

Right, thanks. But then were they any specific service offerings which really drove this growth

or was it a broad based growth for the top client?

For the top client, actually we do work in all areas, we do work in application area, we do work
in business infrastructure area and we do work in BPO areas. So we have the benefit of multiple

service lines fairly propelling growth.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Sashi Bhushan from Prabhudas Liladher. Please

Good afternoon thanks for taking my question. Can you please share the details on the take over
of Citibank Data Center like what is the consideration that w e paid for that and what is the
current utilization? And in the current guidance what is the revenue we are taking from this

account?

Citibank Data Center acquisition is actually a combination of taking over and getting into a
contract with the customer for a longer term relationship and it's a joint effort with Citi, I mean
between Wipro and Citi to grow the data center business where we get support from Citi to get
their data center piece of work for Europe and in return they get benefit of b etter management
and lower cost. And at the same time we are able to leverage on having done it for one of the
largest banks and do it for other European customers in Europe. So from a pure number
perspective, the money outflow is not necessarily very significant, however the relationship and
the contractual commitments by both parties to make it a success is what actually is something
that needs to be kept in mind. But just to give you the number money that has been paid as cash

upfront is 5 million euros.
And what is the current utilization?

So Citibank actually as a customer gives us quite significant utilization to begin with and almost
75% plus of the capacity is being utilized by Citi right from day one. But there is a provision to
keep growing that capacity as we go along and it would help us to partly get compensated by the
growth in the Citi business and partly by getting new customers in. But it does not come with the
challenges that typically you have when you are starting a new data center wherein the utilization

is zero to begin with.
Sure, and in the current guidance what is the revenue we are taking from this acquisition?

We actually signed the deal on the 1 * of July and the work has beg un. So the number in this

quarter may not be very significant.

Okay, also your absolute and offshore revenue declined on quarter-to-quarter on absolute basis,
was that due to some contract which is getting over and it is like quarterly aberration or is there

any trend over?

No, I think if we were to for a moment get away from offshore onsite and look at the macro
picture of how the price moved and how the value moved or the volume moved, you would see
that the volume growth was primarily onsite while the volume growth in offs hore was a little
lower. And price decline that happened in offshore which was 1.3% was more than the volume
growth that we got in offshore which kind of shows up as if there is a revenue decline, but
effectively there is a 0.7% growth in volume in offshor e and getting negated by the 1.3% decline

in price which is why it looks like a decline in offshore revenue.

Hi thanks for taking my question, most of my questions have been answered, but I just want
reconfirmation, the re-banding exercise which you mentioned which has resulted in promotions
of 20,000, is the full impact already factored into this quarter or would it reflect in the next

quarter?

It will come in the current quarter.

It will come in quarter two Subhashni.

Okay sure. And the impact would be close to 1%, is that what you mentioned earlier?

The impact of all the people related in interventions , which is stock units plus the re -banding

exercise put together will be close to 1%.
Okay sure. Thanks a lot, that’s all from my side.
