that a business where i learned the change only have when ordinary people get involved and they getting gauged and they come together to demand after eighty years adore president i stole them and it's not just my bullies the beating heart of our american idea our bold experiment in self governor it's a conviction that we are all created and towed by our creator asserted unable right among them life liberty and the pursuit of apes it be insistent that these rights while self evident have never been so executed that we we the people through the instrument of our democracy can form a more perfect union what a radical idea the great it that our founders gave to us the freedom to change our individual dreams to us set and coil and imagination and the imperative described together as water the

brevities for but one feels we take one step back but the long sweep of the merican been defined by forward more a constant widening of our pounding creed the embrace all nauseated me elisabet that america would reverse agate with set redbud our auto in the pan unleashed the longest legs of job creation in our hesperothen up in the separate cuban people shut down around tolerance and with a fire on a steamer mind i nineteen you might a good sides was said a lot to one but that's what we did that's what you did you were the change enteritis and because of you my almost every measure america a better stronger place then it was one we started antedate world will witness a hallmark of our democracy nonotte peaceful plans for a power from one freely elected president of an extra committed the president like propitiation would ensure the smoothest possible transition just as present bush did for me because it's at all of us the make sure our government can help us meet the many challenges we still fixed we have one we need to do so we have everything we knew the need those challenges after all we were made the welfare most powerful and most respective they should not as are you our dry are diversity and all connectedness capacity for red and we invention means that the future should be on the batten ial will only be realized in if our democracy was only for politics better elected decency about people howell of it but to do the party affiliation with the secular intimate aperture the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now that's what i want to poison to that the state of our democracy understand the matricides not a fire uniform at our founders are guacharaca they compromise the expected us to do the same but they knew that the mother had a basic sense of solidarity the idea that are outward differences were all in this together that we rise or fall as one they've been moments rather history but threaten that solider in the beginning of this century has been one of those times a shrinking world growing in a quality demographic change and the spectre terrorism these forces have in just tasted our security and our prosperity but her testing our democracies when and how we meet these challenges toward democracy what determinability they educate our kids and cragged protect our homeland in other words people determine our future to begin with our democracy long or coat a sense that every one has economic opportunity and the good news is it today he economy bowing again gazes in comes home values in retirement counts are all rising poverty

i'd said and i mean it if any one can put together a plan that is demonstrably better then you prove entered may do up their casemates his many people at last hoisted the more points of the credit but the maypole's lies better but all the real progress and we make we know it's not enough or economy doesn't work as well or grow as fast on a few prosperite expensive a growing middle class and ladders proposal to get in a middle class that economic argument but start or the quality is also prosise to our democratic ideas what one per cent has a master share of wealth and income to many more times in inner cities and in moral tone have been left by the late of factory were the waitress or health care worker whose barely get in by and struggling to pay the bills convinced that the game is fixed against them that the government only serves the interests of the power for that's a ruse for more cynicism and polarization not politic and there no quick fixes to this long term tread i agree or trade should be fair and not just for but the next way of economic dislocation won't come from overseas it will come from the relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good middle class jobs obsolete and so we're going to have to forge new social confectony all our kiditchin they be to give more for the power to do you nightattack more reforms to the tax does so corporations and individuals who read the most from this new economy done a boy there arigato to the country that's made their very success possible can morgue about how to beseech eve these gods but we can't be complacent about the gods themselves for if we don't create opportunity for all people the disaffection and division that is stalled our progress will only sharper in your siccatee's a second

meeting her own very real struggles projects to the challenge is that a lot of people in this country thinks not only the retriever the emigrant or the rule of fur or the trans gender american but also the middle aged white wool from the outside may seem like he's got advantages but has seen his world up ended by economic and cultural and technological change we have to pay attention and listen

strengthened so that gardiston than we are if we all have to try harder we all have to start for the premise that each of our fellow citizens love is contrasts much as we do that they now you hard work and family just like we do said their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own and that's not easy to do for to many in this it's become safe for the retreat into our own bois whether in our neighbourhood or on college campuses or plates abortion or specially our social mediates savanadero look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions in the rise of a naked partisanship increasing economic and regional stratification the splitting reformed in a channel for every case all this makes this great sorting seem natural even nevian creepingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start excepting only information whether it's true or not it fits our opinions instead of basing on pinions on the evidence goatherd retreat that politics is a battle of i des it's our democracy was design he in the course of a healthy debate we prioritize differings and the different means of reaching them but without some common face line of facts without a willingness to admit a new information and conceive that you are ponemah be making a fair point in its science and reason matter then we aranyani that part of what so often makes politics dispirited a canibals rage about deficits when we proposed to spend money on precipices but not one more cutting taxes for corporations how do we latourette party does the same thing is not just is on this selected sorting of the fact itself defeat because as my mom used to tell me really as away catching up with take the challenge of pine the change in jest a year we had arthenice on horn oil we doubled our renewable energy we've led the world to an agreement that as a promise without folderico children won't have time to debate the existence of climate change to be bidding with its effects more environmental estates more economic disruption waves of climate refugees seeking sanctuary a week we can and should argue about the best approach to solve the problem but to simply deny the problem not only betrays you treeton it betrays the essential spirit of this country the essential spirit of innovation and practical problem solving that guided our founder that he

their palm the peril each poses to our democracy is more for reaching then a car bameean the fear of change the fear of people who look or speak or pray differently a contempt for the rule of law that holds leaders of counter an intolerance of the center and free plot the belief that the sword or the gun or the bomb or the propaganda machine is the ultimate arbiter what's true and what's right because of the extraordinary courage of our men amomum because of our intelligence officers and law enforcement and diplomats who support artistically planned and executed a tack on our homeland be facts it although you know land and timber to diana imported remind us of how dangerous radical ization con be our law enforcement agencies are more effective and vigilant that we obtain out ten to thousands of terrorists including binondo is for the leading against it a thinking out their leaders and they can away about half their territory i so will be destroyed and no one who threatens america will ever be thick nose we have so in the odour of my life time to be your commander in sewell but but acting all way if that's not to the job of our military the mareschal buckle when it gives in to fear so just as we as citizens must remain vigilant against external aggression we must guard against a weakening of the bales and make us whom we ought that i for the hat that you have

but not afraid i felicitate but they could not defeat america unless we the tray or constitution and our principles in the fight by the by glass china cannot match our influence around the world unless we give up what we stand for and turn ourselves in the dust enter big country that bully smaller neighbors which brings me to my final in our democracy a democracy is threatened whenever we take it for grandall of that the guataparo should be throwing ourselves into the task of rebuilding our democratic institutions when boirai as some of the lowest among advanced democracies we should be making it easier not harder to vote to we should reduce the cross entrance of money in our politics and insist on the propriety that the comic when congress is this function we should draw or the regal district praises to cater to common to and not return of it happened on a one all of this depends on our participation on each of us excepting the responsibility of citizenship regardless of which way the pendulum of power happens to be swing our constitution is a remarkable beautiful gift but it's early just a piece with partment had no power on its own we the people give it power wheaton and at the citadel whether or not reneweth or not we respect an important all at a time america's no frail thing but began a our long journey to freedom are not assured in his own farewell address george washington wrote that self government is the underpinning of our safety prosperity and liberal but from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken to weaken in your mind the conviction of this truth and so we have to preserve the truth with jealous anxiety that we should reject the first dawning of every attention at any portion of our country from the rest or to infelicities weaken those times when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive the people of good character are even willing to enter in the public so so course would rank the americans with whom we disagree or see no just as miss guided but as malevolent we weaken those ties when we define the some of us as more american than others when we ride off the whole fifteen when we stood back and blame the leaders we elected without examining all roll in electorate of us could be those anxious jealous guardians of our democracies them brace the joy of the past we've been given to continually try and prove this great nation of ours because for all our outward differences we in fact all share the same crowd pipe the most important offices democracies citizen so you think that what our democracy the man i need you not just when there is an lace not just when your own narrow interest is at stake but over the full span of life if you're tired of our guns flames on
