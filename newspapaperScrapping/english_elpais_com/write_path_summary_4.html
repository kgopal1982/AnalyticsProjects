“The worst days are on their way,” Illa said on Friday morning, explaining that the rise of cases is continuing with no clear evidence whether the state of alarm and total lockdown put in place by the central government last week is having the desired effect of halting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.<br/>“We have to achieve this and we have to achieve it as soon as possible.” The latest figures supplied by officials on Friday put the number of deaths at 1,002, which was 30% up on the date just 24 hours before.<br/>Experts say that another great unknown yet to be resolved is whether the isolation measures arrived in time, which will determine whether regions with fewer cases will be less affected by the spread of the virus, or whether it will still arrive, albeit later than in other areas.<br/>Not even the central Health Ministry, which is coordinating the response to the crisis, has been able to clarify whether the rapid tests to diagnose the disease, which were supposed to be ready by the end of this week, are already operational and in which quantities.<br/>Without knowing whether the peak of the epidemic is close, the Health Ministry is unsure of which successful models of dealing with the crisis it should be looking at.<br/>These indicators are key to monitoring the progress of the pandemic in Spain, given that, as Simón admitted yesterday, “it is very likely” that the data does not reflect the real rate of infections given the lack of testing for suspected cases.<br/>With more than a thousand coronavirus deaths and clear signs of overload in various parts of the country’s health network, Spain has begun to enter the darkest phase so far of the ongoing coronavirus.<br/>The fact that no one can say how long this stage will last is perhaps the hardest thing to deal with, but there are also many other questions left to answer.<br/>The number of deaths in the Madrid region yesterday rose by 130 people in just 24 hours.<br/>One of these could be Germany, which, with 14,000 cases already diagnosed, has managed a mortality rate of 0.2%, in contrast with the 5% rate in Spain and the 8% rate in Italy.<br/>
